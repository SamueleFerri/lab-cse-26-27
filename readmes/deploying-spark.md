# Deploying Spark

The goal of this lab is to understand how to deploy Spark applications, locally or on a remote AWS cluster.
For this purpose, **we will switch from Python to Scala**; you will notice that APIs are more or less the same.

To deploy a Spark application, you will need to:
- Compile the code into a JAR file.
- Run the JAR via the *spark-submit* application.

Once executed, the history is stored as JSON file in a preconfigured folder.
To visualize it, you need to run and access the History Server application.

### The jobs

Inside the folder "src/main/scala/utils" you will find:
- A *Commons* file with some utility functions.
- A *Config* file where you need to insert:
  - The name of the S3 bucket you will create in the `s3bucketName` property.

Local input and output paths are resolved against the working directory and converted
to absolute `file:` paths automatically, so no repository path needs to be configured.
Run local jobs from the repository root. Paths such as `/datasets/...` and `/output/...`
are interpreted relative to that root; the initial slash is ignored in local mode.

Inside the folder "src/main/scala/lab104" you will find:
- A *WordCount* file, containing a simple Word Count example on the divinacommedia.txt dataset.
- The *MovieLens* file that (together with the *MovieLensParser*) contains the Scala version of the Spark jobs we did in Lab103.

The jobs are designed to easily switch from local to remote deployments.

## Local deployment

This section covers the local deployment.

### Requirements

All computers in the laboratories are pre-configured with everything you need. 
If you want to work on you local computer, follow the instructions in the [Spark setup](/readmes/spark-setup.md) 
README to install and configure everything you need.

You do *not* need the quay.io Docker image used in previous labs.

> RECOMMENDATION: just run the DevContainer

### History Server

If you are running the DevContainer, the History Server is already up and running.

If you have a local installation, open a terminal on Spark's installation folder ("C:/spark" in lab machines) and launch this command.

```
bin/spark-class.cmd org.apache.spark.deploy.history.HistoryServer
```

In either case, the UI will be available at [http://localhost:18080](http://localhost:18080).

### Deployment

- From the VS Code terminal (with the DevContainer running) or from any terminal positioned on the main folder of the repo (with the local installation), run `./gradlew` to generate the JAR.
You should see it in the "build/libs" folder.
  - It will talke a while to download Gradle the first time
  - *NOTE: if the build fails, delete the folder and try again*
- From the same terminal, run `spark-submit --class lab104.WordCount ./build/libs/BigDataLab.jar local`
- Check out the results in the output folder and the job execution plans in the History Server.
- `mynotes`: from terminal run `docker exec -it elated_mahavira /bin/bash` enter work folder and now run the `spark-submit`
  on mac run `spark-class org.apache.spark.deploy.history.HistoryServer`


## Remote deployment

This section covers the remote deployment on AWS using the AWS Academy.

### Requirements

For this part, you need an account on AWS Academy. 
This service offers *classes* where students are allowed free usage of some AWS resources up to 50$; 
registration is necessary, but no credit card is needed.

Classes have a **duration of 6 months**; after that, all resources will be lost. To give you access for the full academic year, there will be two classes:
- Class 1: valid from October 1, 2026, to March 31, 2027.
- Class 2: valid from April 1, 2027, to September 30, 2027.

Invites are sent to all students registered to the course on [Virtuale](https://virtuale.unibo.it) as soon as the class begins.

**Invites are not automatic!** If you register on Virtuale when the invites have already been sent, you must send the teacher an email to request access.  

When you receive the invitation link, proceed with the registration. Contact the teacher in case of issues.

### Accessing the Virtual Lab on AWS Academy

The Virtual Lab must be turned on every time you want to work with the AWS resources. **It turns off automatically after 4 hours**, unless you ask for an extension of 4 more hours.

- [**Access AWS Academy here**](https://awsacademy.instructure.com/)
- Go to "Modules" > "Launch AWS Academy Learner Lab"
  - Agree to the terms and conditions (only the first time)
- Click the "Start Lab" button (top-right corner)
  - The first time, it will take about 5 minutes to startup; next times, it will take only a few seconds
- A *countdown* will appear, starting from 4 hours
  - **To extend the 4-hour window**, click the "Start Lab" button again
- A *credit counter* will appear, indicating the amount of credit left
- Click on "AWS" (top-left corner) when you have a green light
  - You will now be in your own virtual lab
  - This is the ***Console home*** of the Virtual Lab
- **Click the "End Lab"** button (top-right corner) at the end of class
  - If you don't, it should automatically shutdown in 4 hours, but 1) it will consume credit (only EC2 instances are automatically shut down), and 2) better safe than sorry.

#### Troubleshooting (Q&A)

>*Q: What happens when I end the Virtual lab?*  
>A: It depends on the service: data in S3 will persist (and consume very little credit even when the Virtual Lab is down); EMR clusters (and all data within them, e.g., anything you save onto HDFS) will be completely destroyed.
>
>*Q: What happens when I finish my credits?*  
>A: You will not be able to use the Virtual Lab anymore, not even the data in S3. However, you can request an additional Virtual Lab environment to be instantiated on a different account (with a different email), just ask the teacher.

After launching the Virtual Lab, you can interact with AWS resources in two alternative ways.
- GUI: it's nicer and doesn't require you to learn commands and syntax; 
however, it's slow and the layout can change unpredictably.
- AWS CLI (preferred): it requires you to learn commands and syntax, 
but it is less subject to evolution issues; also, it is useful to understand how
the interaction with AWS could be automated (infrastructure-as-code)

We will use the AWS CLI. 

### AWS CLI configuration

To use the AWS CLI, you need to create a profile and a key-pair (.ppk). 
**Use a Git Bash** opened on the root directory of this repo for the bash commands below (AWS CLI is not in the DevContainer).


#### Profile creation and update

>**IMPORTANT** - 
> Profile information (access key, secret access key, and token) must be updated every time you restart the Virtual Lab.

In the "aws" folder of this repo, rename the "credentials-example" file to "credentials" and insert the following:
- AWS Access Key ID
- AWS Secret Access Key
- AWS Session Token

All these can be found in the AWS Acamedy website (where you click the "Start Lab" button); 
here, look for AWS details > AWS CLI > aws_access_key_id (and the other fields are just below).

Next, set the environment variable pointing to the profile.

```bash
export AWS_SHARED_CREDENTIALS_FILE=aws/credentials
export AWS_CONFIG_FILE=aws/config
```

#### Key-pair creation

Key pairs are needed to launch Spark applications. 
Once created, you can reuse them as much as you want, but you cannot download them again.
If you lose the file, you need to create a new key pair.

Issue the following commands to:
- Create the "keys" directory (if it doesn't exist)
- Create a key pair (replace <your_key_pair> with a name of your choice)
- Show the list of created keys

```bash
mkdir aws/keys
aws ec2 create-key-pair --key-format ppk --key-name <your_key_pair> --output text > aws/keys/<your_key_pair>.ppk
aws ec2 describe-key-pairs
```

The generated .ppk may need to be edited; open it and check that:
- it begins with "PuTTY-User-Key-File-2: ssh-rsa"
- it ends with the Private-MAC

#### Troubleshooting (Q&A)

>*Q: I get a 400 error when creating the key-pair.*  
>A: The profile and/or the token may have been copy-pasted incorrectly.
> Try to recreate them, even if you are sure that you did it correctly.
>
>*Q: I get an error message stating that the .ppk is not valid.*  
>A: The .ppk may be incorrect; check that:
>- it begins with "PuTTY-User-Key-File-2: ssh-rsa"
>- it ends with the Private-MAC
>
>*Q: I get an error message stating that the access permissions on the .ppk are not valid.*  
>A: Change permissions to make the file accessible only by the owner; for this, use the command ```chmod 400 file.ppk```.


### Upload datasets on S3

Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service) is the basic storage service offered by Amazon.

> **IMPORTANT**: all datasets used in previous labs have already been uploaded 
> to an open-access bucket called `unibo-bd2627-egallinucci-shared`, 
> so you do not need to upload them too. Still, you must create your own bucket to:
> - Save jobs' output
> - Upload the datasets you will use for the project

Documentation for CLI commands is available [here (lower-level commands)](https://awscli.amazonaws.com/v2/documentation/api/latest/reference/s3/index.html#cli-aws-s3) and [here (higher-level commands)](https://awscli.amazonaws.com/v2/documentation/api/latest/reference/s3api/index.html#cli-aws-s3api).
Here is a list of the most common ones.

- See available buckets 
  ```bash
  aws s3api list-buckets
  ```

- **Create your bucket**; replace <your_bucket_name> with something like *unibo-bd2627-egallinucci*
  ```bash
  aws s3api create-bucket --bucket <your_bucket_name>
  ```

- **Create datasets folders**
  ```bash
  aws s3api put-object --bucket <your_bucket_name> --key datasets/
  aws s3api put-object --bucket <your_bucket_name> --key datasets/big/
  ```

- Copy, rename, and delete folders
  ```  bash
  aws s3 cp s3://<your_bucket_name>/datasets/ s3://<your_bucket_name>/somefoldername/
  
  aws s3 mv s3://<your_bucket_name>/somefoldername/ s3://<your_bucket_name>/foldertodelete/

  aws s3 rm s3://<your_bucket_name>/foldertodelete/
  ```

- **Upload datasets** (all the files that you find in the "datasets" folder)
  ```bash
  aws s3api put-object --bucket <your_bucket_name> --key datasets/capra.txt --body datasets/capra.txt
  # Repeat for other files as well
  aws s3api put-object --bucket <your_bucket_name> --key datasets/big/ml-movies.csv --body datasets/big/ml-movies.csv
  # Repeat for other big files as well
  ```

- Check contents of bucket and folders
  ```bash
  aws s3api list-objects-v2 --bucket <your_bucket_name>
  aws s3api list-objects-v2 --bucket <your_bucket_name> --prefix datasets/
  ```

All these files will continue to be available even after the Virtual Lab is ended.

### Create a log folder

This will be needed to debug applications in the case of failures

```bash
aws s3api put-object --bucket <your_bucket_name> --key log/
```

### Create a cluster with EMR

Amazon EMR (Elastic Map Reduce) is the service used to deploy clusters preconfigured with Hadoop-stack software (e.g., HDFS, Spark, Kafka, etc.).
It relys on Amazon EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud), which is the (more general) service used to request machines.
Documentation is available [here](https://awscli.amazonaws.com/v2/documentation/api/latest/reference/emr/index.html#cli-aws-emr). To decide which EMR versions to load, see [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/emr/latest/ReleaseGuide/emr-release-components.html).


Create a cluster with the following command.
```
aws emr create-cluster \
    --name "Big Data Cluster" \
    --log-uri "s3://<your_s3_log_directory>" \
    --release-label "emr-8.1.0" \
    --log-uri "s3://aws-logs/elasticmapreduce" \
    --applications Name=Hadoop Name=Spark \
    --instance-groups InstanceGroupType=MASTER,InstanceCount=1,InstanceType=m4.large InstanceGroupType=CORE,InstanceCount=2,InstanceType=m4.large \
    --service-role EMR_DefaultRole \
    --ec2-attributes InstanceProfile=EMR_EC2_DefaultRole,KeyName=<your_key_pair_name> \
    --region "us-east-1"
```

Notes:
- This is the default configuration for laboratories, but you can change it for the project (e.g., to increase the computational power if needed)
- See other examples [here](https://github.com/aws/aws-cli/blob/develop/awscli/examples/emr/create-cluster-examples.rst)
- **Make sure that you replace the *log directory* and *key-pair name* in the command**
- Note that the command returns the cluster_id (which could be needed for other commands) 

Show the last deployed clusters; to run jobs, you must wait for the status of the cluster 
to go from **STARTING** to **WAITING** (it takes some minutes).

```bash
aws emr list-clusters --max-items 1
```

To enable SSH connections (must be done only once, but one cluster must have been created first), if ever needed:
```bash
aws ec2 authorize-security-group-ingress --group-name ElasticMapReduce-master --ip-permissions IpProtocol=tcp,FromPort=22,ToPort=22,IpRanges="[{CidrIp=0.0.0.0/0}]"
```

To terminate a cluster:

```bash
aws emr terminate-clusters --cluster-ids <cluster_id>
```

### Deployment

- Remote jobs use the same "aws/credentials" file as the AWS CLI (see [AWS CLI configuration](#aws-cli-configuration)); remember to update this file every time you restart the Virtual Lab.
- From a terminal positioned on the main folder of the repo, run `./gradlew` to generate the JAR.
  - You should see it in the "build/libs" folder; if the process fails, delete the folder and try again.
- Upload the jar to S3 with:
    ```bash
    aws s3api put-object --bucket <your_bucket> --key BigDataLab.jar --body build/libs/BigDataLab.jar
    ```
- Run the jar with:
    ```bash
    aws emr add-steps --cluster-id <your_cluster_id> --steps '[{"Args": ["spark-submit", "--deploy-mode","cluster", "--class","<package>.<className>", "s3://<your_bucket>/BigDataLab.jar", "sharedRemote"], "Type":"CUSTOM_JAR", "ActionOnFailure":"CONTINUE", "Jar":"command-runner.jar", "Properties":"", "Name":"My Spark app"}]'
    ```
    - If you want to request specific resources, you can add (after the `--class` option and *before* the jar) the following options (adjust the values according to your needs and the resources available in the cluster):
        - `"--executor-memory", "4g",`
        - `"--executor-cores", "4"`
        - `"--num-executors", "2"`
        - `"--driver-memory", "2g"`
        - `"--driver-cores", "2"`
- Wait for the application to finish (you should see "final status: SUCCEEDED" in the last Application report); check it in the UI or via this command:
    
    ```bash
    aws emr describe-step --cluster-id <your_cluster_id> \
        --step-id <your_step_id> \
        --query 'Step.Status'
    ```
- Check out the results in the "output" folder in your S3 bucket (via CLI or GUI).
  - From the *Console home* of the Virtual Lab, select the S3 service, click on the bucket 
    and navigate to the output folder
  - Data cannot be viewed from the GUI, you must download the file(s)
- In the case of failures:
  - Check the log of the application (make sure that the cluster was created with the `--log-uri` parameter)
  - If you have any `print()` in the application, they will go in the stdout of the Application Master Process in YARN; to see it:
    - Enable SSH connections (see the Cluster configuration section)
    - Connect via SSH using Putty following the instructions in AWS's UI (EMR > select your cluster > Applications > click on Enable an SSH connection)
    - Once connected, run the following command
        ```bash
        yarn logs \
        -applicationId <your_application_id> \
        -appOwner hadoop \
        -am ALL \
        -log_files stdout
        ```
- Check out the job execution plans in the History Server (via GUI). 
  - From the *Console home* of the Virtual Lab, select the EMR service, click on the last-created cluster and click on the link to the "Spark History Server". Here, you can download the event log: you can put it in the local history server to see it locally, and it is a file that you need to deliver for the project.
